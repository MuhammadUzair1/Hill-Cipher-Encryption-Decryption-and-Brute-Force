# Hill-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption-and-Brute-Force

This program is for a university project that can provide encryption text and will also tell wheter the decryption in possible with the same key.
Conversion of plain text to cipher text can also be done
Brute force attack can also be done.
  --  for keeping execution time minimum both cipher and plain text is taken as input for the brute force and stops the code execution once the plain text and cipher text becomes same
